# chaoss-microtasks
 Repository for storing and documenting micro-tasks of GrimoireLab Project for GSoC 2020 under CHAOSS.
 

## About Me

I am a fourth year undergraduate pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kollam, India. I am a member of [FOSS@Amrita](https://amfoss.in), open source club in our campus. My area of interests are Data Analytics and Machine Learning and I have good experience with Python.

I have been contributing to CHAOSS for almost an year. I tried for GSoC 2019 too and this repo has the micro-tasks for last year, [vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks-19](https://github.com/vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks-19).


## Microtasks

- [ ] [microtask-1]
- [ ] [microtask-2]
- [ ] [microtask-3]
- [ ] [microtask-4]
- [ ] [microtask-5]
- [ ] [microtask-6]


I went through the three ideas, [#285](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/issues/285), [#286](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/issues/286), [#287](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/issues/287) for the GrimoireLab Project. I would like to spend some more time reading about each project and choosing one. As the inital microtasks (the first six) are same for all the ideas, I would like to start working on them.
