 Repository for storing and documenting micro-tasks of GrimoireLab Project for GSoC 2020 under CHAOSS.
 

## About Me

I am a fourth year undergraduate pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kollam, India. I am a member of [FOSS@Amrita](https://amfoss.in), open source club in our campus. My area of interests are Data Analytics and Machine Learning and I have good experience with Python.

I have been contributing to CHAOSS for almost an year. I tried for GSoC 2019 too and this repo has the micro-tasks for last year, [vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks-19](https://github.com/vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks-19).

I would like to submit the proposal for the idea, [GSoC Idea: Creating Quality models using GrimoireLab and CHAOSS metrics (#287)](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/issues/287) of the GrimoireLab Project.
