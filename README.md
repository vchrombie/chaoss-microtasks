# chaoss-microtasks
 Repository for storing and documenting micro-tasks of GrimoireLab Project for GSoC 2020 under CHAOSS.
 

## About Me

I am a fourth year undergraduate pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kollam, India. I am a member of [FOSS@Amrita](https://amfoss.in), open source club in our campus. My area of interests are Data Analytics and Machine Learning and I have good experience with Python.

I have been contributing to CHAOSS for almost an year. I tried for GSoC 2019 too and this repo has the micro-tasks for last year, [vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks-19](https://github.com/vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks-19).

I would like to submit the proposal for the idea, [GSoC Idea: Creating Quality models using GrimoireLab and CHAOSS metrics (#287)](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/issues/287) of the GrimoireLab Project.


## Microtasks

### :heavy_check_mark:  microtask-1

>  Set up Perceval to be executed from PyCharm.

You can find the detailed steps [here](https://github.com/vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks/tree/master/microtask-1#microtask-1).
You can check the demo too, if you have any doubt. :slightly_smiling_face: 

### :heavy_check_mark:  microtask-2

>  Create a Python script to execute Perceval via its Python interface using the GitLab and GitHub backends. Feel free to select any target repository.

You can find the notebook for the code [here](https://github.com/vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks/blob/master/microtask-2/microtask-2.ipynb).

### :heavy_check_mark:  microtask-3

>  Based on the JSON documents produced by Perceval and its source code, try to answer the following questions:
> 
>  What is the meaning of the JSON attribute 'timestamp', 'updated_on', 'origin', 'category', 'uuid', 'search_fields'?
>
>  How many categories do the GitHub and GitLab backends have?
>
>  What is stored in the attribute `data` of each JSON document produced by Perceval?

Answers to the above questions can be found [here](https://github.com/vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks/tree/master/microtask-3#microtask-3).

### :heavy_check_mark:  microtask-4

>  Set up a dev environment to work on GrimoireLab. Have a look to https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred#setting-up-a-pycharm-dev-environment.

You can find the detailed explanation of how to setup GrimoireLab from [here](https://github.com/vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks/tree/master/microtask-4#microtask-4).

### :heavy_check_mark:  microtask-5

>  Execute micro-mordred to collect, enrich and visualize data from Git and GitHub repositories.

You can find the detailed procudure for executing micro-mordred from [here](https://github.com/vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks/tree/master/microtask-5#microtask-5).

### :heavy_check_mark:  microtask-6

> Using the dev tools in Kibiter, create a query that counts the number of unique authors on a Git repository from 2018-01-01 until 2019-01-01.

You can find the query and the explanation [here](https://github.com/vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks/tree/master/microtask-6#microtask-6).

### :heavy_check_mark:  microtask-7

> Install and use [elasticdump](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticdump) to download the mapping and data of an ElasticSearch index.

The procedure and explanation can be found [here](https://github.com/vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks/blob/master/microtask-7/README.md#microtask-7)

### :heavy_check_mark:  microtask-8

> Set up [Prosoul](https://github.com/Bitergia/prosoul) to be executed from PyCharm.

The link to the YouTube video is [Setting up Prosoul with PyCharm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wU1ck4ZrUw&t=20s). :rocket: 

You can find the steps [here](https://github.com/vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks/blob/master/microtask-8/README.md#microtask-8).

### :heavy_check_mark:  microtask-9

> Create your first Quality Model with Prosoul. Optionally, try perform an assessment with the data at https://github.com/valeriocos/prosoul-input-data (it contains a dump of an index and its mapping) to be imported in your local instance of ElasticSearch.

The detailed procedure with results can be found [here](https://github.com/vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks/tree/master/microtask-9#microtask-9).

### :heavy_check_mark:  microtask-10

> Submit at least a PR to one of the GrimoireLab repositories to fix an issue, improve the documentation, etc.

You can find the whole list [here](https://github.com/vchrombie/chaoss-microtasks/tree/master/microtask-10#microtask-10).
